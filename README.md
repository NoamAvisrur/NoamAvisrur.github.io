hello world!
im Noam Avisrur and ive created this site to tell you little bit about myself :)! 

After couple years of studying digital media & working in the advertising & marketing field,
I learned that I'm more into the technical side of things.
The web programming world and how it ticks have always fascinated me a lot!
And so,I've decided to fully dive into it!

Today, I study the different codes, languages and technologies
of front and back End as a full-stack web developer at John Bryce Hi-Tech College
alongside constant self-practicing.

I'm currently looking for an opportunity to integrate in the professional side of web development.
I'm ambitious, diligent, a team player and have a great passion for learning new things!
